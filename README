This folder contains code for analysis of tracked evaporation data as presented in the submitted manuscript "Seasonal Variations in Moisture Origin Explain Spatial Gradients in Precipitation Isotope Seasonality on Coastal Western Greenland" by A. A. Cluett, E.K. Thomas, S. M. Evans, and P. W. Keys.

PrecipitationshedAnalysis_20200305.m contains all manuscript analyses.

KANG_region_grid.mat, SUAQ_region_grid.mat, and THULE_region_grid.mat are masks of the sink regions.

Custom_region_masks.mat contains masks to classify source regions.

Grid.mat contains spatial reference data for tracked evaporation data files.

Tracked evaporation data files are archived on figshare.
